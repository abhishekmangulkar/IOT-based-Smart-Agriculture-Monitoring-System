# IOT-based-Smart-Agriculture-Monitoring-System

Agriculture is done in every country from ages. Agriculture is the science and art of 
cultivating plants. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human 
civilization. Agriculture is done manually from ages. As the world is trending into new 
technologies and implementations it is a necessary goal to trend up with agriculture also. 
IOT plays a very important role in smart agriculture. IOT sensors are capable of providing 
information about agriculture fields. we have proposed an IOT and smart agriculture 
system using automation. This IOT based Agriculture monitoring system makes use of 
wireless sensor networks that collects data from different sensors deployed at various nodes 
and sends it through the wireless protocol. This smart agriculture using IOT system is 
powered by Arduino, it consists of Temperature sensor, Moisture sensor, water level sensor, 
DC motor and GPRS module. When the IOT based agriculture monitoring system starts it 
checks the water level, humidity and moisture level. It sends SMS alert on the phone about 
the levels. Sensors sense the level of water if it goes down, it automatically starts the water 
pump. If the temperature goes above the level, fan starts. This all is displayed on the LCD 
display module. This all is also seen in IOT where it shows information of Humidity, 
Moisture and water level with date and time, based on per minute. Temperature can be set 
on a particular level; it is based on the type crops cultivated. If we want to close the water 
forcefully on IOT there is button given from where water pump can be forcefully stopped.
